# Basic Tree Traversal

Hobbit Family Tree Traversal using Python
I undertook this project due to the desire to sharpen my Python skills. As this was one of the first few projects I did, I made quite a number of rookie mistakes, however, it was a valuable learning experience. I wanted to gain a better understanding of Python, which I managed to achieve in this project. Through this project, I improved my problem-solving abilities, learned to handle data organization more effectively, and honed my debugging skills. Despite the initial challenges and mistakes, it ultimately helped me become a more skilled and confident Python programmer.
