# Developed Frogger in Typescript/Javascript using the principles of Functional Programming

This project was a valuable learning experience for me, as it enabled me to explore both game development and functional programming paradigms. This project allowed me to apply functional programming concepts like immutability, pure functions, and higher-order functions in a real-world context, which significantly improved my coding skills. I also improved my problem-solving abilities by overcoming game development challenges, such as collision detection and game mechanics. Furthermore, I had fun and enjoyed building a classic game like Frogger, which motivated me to learn more. The final product was a fully functional game that gave me immense satisfaction and reinforced my passion for programming. Additionally, I expanded my skill set by learning the basics of HTML for my game.
