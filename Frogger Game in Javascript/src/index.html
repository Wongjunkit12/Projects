      <h3>Instructions:</h3>
      <p>
        Use WASD to move Frogger. R to restart the game. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Hitting a car (red) will kill Frogger. The river is heavily polluted with dangerous chemicals, causing instant death to Frogger
        if he so happens to touch it. Stand on planks (brown) to avoid certain death! Shhh the crocodiles (yellow) are asleep. 
        Although crocodiles can be safely stepped on, they will get angry if you stay too long! 
        Crocodiles will attack and kill Frogger if it stands on them for more than 2 seconds! So keep moving to avoid certain death!
      </p>
      <p>
        Why did Frogger cause the road? To get to the targets of course! Reach the targets at the end (non-purple holes) to
        achieve a whopping 100 score each!. Filling already filled
        targets will give no score. Filling all 6 targets on the other hand will add another 200 to your score.
        However, it comes at a cost... Speed of all in game obstacles (cars, planks etc) will increase as a result! 
        Filling all 6 targets will clear the targets, ready for Frogger to fill it again!
        Each unique row move will grant an additional 5 score too.
        Frogger is hungry, so satisfying his hunger will surely reward you! Eating flies (orange) will give an extra 50 score!
      </p>
      <p>
        What happens when Frogger die? Don't worry, you can restart the game to try again. Your High Score will be saved, 
        so you can try to beat it in the next attempt!
