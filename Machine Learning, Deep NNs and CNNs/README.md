# Machine Learning, Deep NNs and CNNs in Jupyter

This project involves developing Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for my practice. One such task I did was building a simple image classification model using the EMNIST dataset, which consists of grayscale images of handwritten letters. Through this, I have demonstrated my understanding of certain key concepts like activation functions, forward and backward propagation and model robustness.

In this project, I implemented various project components, including data preprocessing, model architecture design and hyperparameter tuning. TensorFlow was utilised to construct a feedforward neural network with multiple layers. For experimentation, different activation functions were used to see the output and compared and analysed with each other. Additionally, I explored techniques such as label smoothing, data augmentation and adversarial training to enhance model performance and robustness.

This project taught me the intricacies of designing and training deep neural networks for real-world applications. I gained practical experience in implementing CNNs and understanding their advantages in image recognition tasks. Additionally, I developed hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation skills, which are crucial for optimising performance. Overall, this project significantly enhanced my machine-learning capabilities and prepared me for future endeavours in the field.
