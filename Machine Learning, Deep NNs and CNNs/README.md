In this project, I focused on applying practical machine learning knowledge to develop deep neural networks (DNNs), including feedforward and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The assignment involved building a simple image classification model using the EMNIST dataset, which consists of grayscale images representing handwritten letters. Through this project, I demonstrated my understanding of key concepts such as activation functions, forward and backward propagation, and model robustness.
I implemented various components of the project, including data preprocessing, model architecture design, and hyperparameter tuning. I utilized TensorFlow to construct a feedforward neural network with multiple layers and experimented with different activation functions. Additionally, I explored techniques such as label smoothing, data augmentation, and adversarial training to enhance model performance and robustness. This comprehensive approach allowed me to gain hands-on experience in deep learning while developing a solid foundation in image classification applications.

From this project, I learned the intricacies of designing and training deep neural networks for real-world applications. I gained practical experience in implementing CNNs and understanding their advantages in image recognition tasks. Additionally, I developed skills in hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation, which are crucial for optimizing performance. The exploration of advanced techniques like data augmentation and adversarial training provided valuable insights into improving model robustness against various challenges. Overall, this project significantly enhanced my machine learning capabilities and prepared me for future endeavors in the field.
