# Using MARS to translate code from Python to MIPS assembly code faithfully.

I undertook the project of translating Python code to MIPS assembly using MARS for several reasons. Firstly, it provided me with an invaluable opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of computer architecture and the intricacies of how high-level code gets executed at the machine level. This endeavour helped me strengthen my proficiency in both Python and MIPS assembly, making me a more skilled programmer in these languages. Additionally, it served as an excellent educational exercise, allowing me to bridge the gap between high-level and low-level languages, a knowledge base that's crucial for anyone looking to excel in computer science and programming. This project strengthened my understanding of time complexity as it delves into the intricacies of assembly code for simple things in Python like For loops or conditionals.
