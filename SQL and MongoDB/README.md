# Project: Veterinary Clinic Database System - From DDL to MongoDB Integration

I undertook this project to develop a comprehensive database system for a veterinary clinic, encompassing both relational database design and NoSQL implementation. The multi-phase project involved creating precise DDL statements, implementing complex business rules, developing PL/SQL procedures, and integrating MongoDB for document-based data management. My proficiency in SQL significantly improved as I crafted complex queries for data definition (DDL), data manipulation (DML), and data retrieval. This included creating tables, inserting data, and managing transactions, which deepened my understanding of relational databases. Additionally, I learned the importance of implementing constraints such as primary keys, foreign keys, and triggers to maintain data integrity and enforce business rules within the database.

The project also enhanced my grasp of transaction management principles, ensuring that operations are atomic and consistent, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the database during concurrent operations by multiple users. Writing PL/SQL procedures and triggers allowed me to automate processes within the database, reinforcing my understanding of procedural programming in SQL. Furthermore, transitioning to MongoDB provided insights into NoSQL databases, particularly in handling unstructured data and working with JSON documents. Overall, this project not only improved my technical skills in SQL and database management but also equipped me with an understanding of how databases operate in real-world applications, preparing me for future challenges in data management and analysis.
