## R Studio and Linux commands for data aggregation and processing and creating visualisations

I embarked on the project of using R Studio and Linux commands like awk for data aggregation, processing, and creating visualizations because I wanted to expand my data manipulation and visualization skills, particularly in a Linux environment. This project allowed me to explore the powerful capabilities of R Studio for data analysis, which has wide-ranging applications in data science and research. Additionally, learning Linux commands like awk was beneficial for efficiently handling large datasets and automating data preprocessing tasks. This project not only improved my proficiency in R and Linux but also enhanced my data analysis and visualization capabilities, making me better equipped to work on data-centric projects and draw meaningful insights from diverse datasets. It was a valuable experience that broadened my skill set in data-related tasks and equipped me with a versatile toolkit for future projects.
