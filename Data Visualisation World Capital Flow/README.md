# Data Visualisation on the Global Capital Flow - Mapping the Intricate Web of International Trade

This project centers around visualizing the movement of capital between countries through international trade, specifically focusing on imports and exports of goods. The visualization utilizes three datasets: the world export and import dataset (Awan, 2023), the world GDP data (Tas, 2022) from the World Bank, and geographical coordinates for each country (Mooney, 2020). Each dataset is normalized to US$ billions, excluding countries with missing or inconsistent data. Various visualization techniques were employed, including choropleth maps to depict capital flow intensities geographically, bubble plots to illustrate the relationship between GDP and trade volume, and bar charts to compare export and import values across countries. Each visualization was carefully selected to enhance storytelling through effective design principles such as color usage, figure-ground relationships, and sequential narratives. This comprehensive analysis not only reveals patterns in global capital movement but also highlights critical economic insights relevant to stakeholders in various fields.
