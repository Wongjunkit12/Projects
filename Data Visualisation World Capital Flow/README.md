# Data Visualisation on the Global Capital Flow - Mapping the Intricate Web of International Trade

This project centres around visualising the movement of capital between countries through international trade, specifically focusing on imports and exports of goods. The visualisation utilises three datasets: the world export and import dataset, the world GDP data from the World Bank, and geographical coordinates for each country. Each dataset is normalised to US$ billions, excluding countries with missing or inconsistent data. Various visualisation techniques were employed, including choropleth maps to depict capital flow intensities geographically, bubble plots to illustrate the relationship between GDP and trade volume, and bar charts to compare export and import values across countries. Each visualisation was carefully selected to enhance storytelling through effective design principles such as colour usage, figure-ground relationship, and sequential narratives.

The visualisation aims to provide users with insights into the dynamics of global trade and the interconnectedness of economies. By illustrating these capital flows, the project enables a diverse audience—including business professionals, economists, policymakers, educators, and the general public—to better understand economic trends and trade balances, ultimately fostering informed decision-making. Through this project, I learnt the importance of data normalisation for accurate comparisons and honed my skills in selecting effective visualisation techniques to convey complex information. Additionally, analysing the data enhanced my critical thinking abilities. Overall, this project significantly improved my technical skills in data visualisation while deepening my insights into international economics.
