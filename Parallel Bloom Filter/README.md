## Bloom Filter: Parallel vs Serial Implementation for Optimized Membership Testing

I undertook this project to explore the efficiency of the Bloom Filter, a space-efficient probabilistic data structure known for its rapid membership testing capabilities. By implementing the algorithm in both serial and parallel computing environments, I aimed to analyse performance differences in execution time and speedup. This dual approach highlighted the Bloom Filter's strengths in handling large datasets while minimising memory usage, as well as the significant performance gains achievable through parallel processing.

Through comparative analysis between serial and parallel implementations, I gained concrete experience in measuring and optimising distributed system performance, learning how factors like network latency and data distribution patterns impact actual speedup achievements. This project not only enhanced my grasp of probabilistic algorithms but also equipped me with practical skills in cloud computing, DevOps practices, and distributed system design - competencies that are increasingly essential in modern software engineering. Furthermore, this experience enhanced my programming skills and analytical thinking, equipping me with practical tools for tackling complex computational challenges in various domains.
