## Basics of Data Science in Jupyter Notebook using pandas library and matplotlib library

My motivation for this project was to explore the amazing world of data analysis and visualization. This project was my first step into data science and it helped me learn the basic concepts of data manipulation and visualization. I used pandas to clean and preprocess data effectively, and matplotlib to create insightful visualizations. This project was a catalyst for my data science journey, as it helped me discover valuable insights from data and communicate them through visuals, ultimately improving my problem-solving skills and opening up new possibilities for more advanced data science projects in the future.
