## Distributed Simulation of EV Charging Grid Using MPI and POSIX Threads

In this project, I designed and simulated a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) for an Electric Vehicle (EV) charging grid using C programming. The simulation utilised a combination of Message Passing Interface (MPI) and POSIX threads to facilitate efficient communication and process management. MPI was chosen for its robust framework that supports message-based communication and the creation of virtual topologies, such as Cartesian grids, which are ideal for simulating the WSN. Meanwhile, POSIX threads were employed to simulate the charging ports within each node, allowing for lightweight data sharing and synchronisation through mutexes and condition variables. The project presented unique challenges in managing inter-process communication, thread synchronisation, and data collection across different computing environments, from local machines to cloud infrastructure.

Through comparative analysis of performance metrics between local and cloud deployments, I deepened my understanding of distributed system scalability and communication overhead. The project taught me practical lessons about the tradeoffs between parallel computing paradigms, the importance of efficient message passing in distributed systems, and the real-world implications of system architecture choices on performance. This hands-on experience with both high-level distributed computing concepts and low-level implementation details has equipped me with crucial skills for designing and optimizing large-scale distributed systems, particularly in the emerging field of smart infrastructure.
