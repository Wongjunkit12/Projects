## RPG Potion Trading Game using Advanced Data Structures like HashMaps amd AVL Trees

I undertook the task of creating an RPG Potion Trading Game using advanced data structures like HashMaps and AVL Trees because I was eager to explore the practical applications of these data structures in a game context. This project offered an excellent opportunity to enhance my programming skills and deepen my understanding of data structures. By implementing HashMaps, I learned how to efficiently manage player inventory and potion trading. AVL Trees, on the other hand, provided a valuable lesson in maintaining balanced data structures for efficient item pricing and trading mechanics. Overall, this project not only improved my proficiency in Python but also sharpened my problem-solving abilities, as I had to tackle complex game mechanics and balance the gameplay, making it a rewarding and educational experience that combined my love for gaming with my passion for programming.
