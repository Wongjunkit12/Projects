In this project, I focused on visualizing how individual demographic characteristics—such as race, gender, job title, and experience—impact salaries. The aim was to create an engaging and informative visualization that helps users understand the dynamics of income generation and highlights potential income inequalities. By revealing how various factors influence salary levels, the visualization empowers job seekers to make informed career choices and encourages discussions around wage parity and equitable treatment in the workplace.

This project not only enhanced my technical skills in data visualization and statistical analysis but also highlighted the power of data to drive conversations about workplace equity, personal career development, and socioeconomic understanding. The work is a testament to how thoughtful data presentation can transform raw numbers into actionable insights that can potentially influence individual career choices and broader societal discussions about fair compensation. Furthermore, this comprehensive analysis also illuminated systemic issues related to income disparities among different groups and potential discrimination faced.
