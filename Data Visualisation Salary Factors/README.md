# Data Visualisation of Salary Factors - Unveiling Income Determinants and Workplace Inequities

In this project, I focused on visualising how individual demographic characteristics—such as race, gender, job title, and experience—impact salaries. The dataset used for this visualisation consists of 6,704 data points across five variables: age, experience, job title, education level and salary. I employed various visualisation techniques, including scatter plots, bar charts, and box plots, to effectively convey the relationships within the data. Each visualisation was carefully analysed to conclude salary trends based on demographic factors. 

This project not only enhanced my technical skills in data visualization and statistical analysis but also highlighted the power of data to drive conversations about workplace equity, personal career development, and socioeconomic understanding. The work is a testament to how thoughtful data presentation can transform raw numbers into actionable insights that can potentially influence individual career choices and broader societal discussions about fair compensation. Furthermore, this comprehensive analysis also illuminated systemic issues related to income disparities among different groups and potential discrimination faced.
