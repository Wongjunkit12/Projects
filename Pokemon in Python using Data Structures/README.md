# Simplistic Pokemon Fighting Game using Data Structures and ADTs.

I decided to create a Pokemon Team Fighting Game using data structures and Abstract Data Types (ADTs) like stacks and circular queues because I wanted to challenge myself in applying these fundamental concepts to a game development scenario. This project allowed me to not only solidify my understanding of Python but also provide hands-on experience in utilising data structures like stacks and circular queues to manage game mechanics effectively. Designing the game's battle system required creative problem-solving, and enhancing my critical thinking skills. Moreover, by combining my passion for Pokemon with programming, I found this project incredibly enjoyable, motivating me to learn and experiment more in the world of game development and data structures.
