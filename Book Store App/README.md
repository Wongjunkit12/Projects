# Book Store Mobile Application

I took on the project of developing a mobile app in Android Studio using Java to create a rudimentary book store application because I wanted to gain practical experience in mobile app development and learn how to integrate Firebase real-time databases and local SQL relational databases into an application. This project offered me valuable insights into the complete app development lifecycle, from user interface design to data storage and retrieval. Working with Firebase allowed me to understand cloud-based data synchronisation while implementing a local SQL database enhanced my knowledge of data persistence. Moreover, building a RecyclerView to display user-submitted book information taught me the essentials of creating dynamic user interfaces in Android. Overall, this project not only improved my Android development skills but also equipped me with the knowledge needed to work on more complex and data-driven mobile app projects in the future.
