## Turn-based 2D Elden Ring game in Java using OOP and SOLID principles

I embarked on the project of creating a turn-based 2D Elden Ring game in Java, while strictly adhering to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and SOLID principles because I aimed to deepen my expertise in software design and game development. This endeavour allowed me to apply the fundamental principles of OOP, such as encapsulation and inheritance, to a real-world game project, enhancing my coding practices and promoting code maintainability and scalability. Additionally, focusing on SOLID principles improved the overall design of my code, making it more robust and flexible. This project was a crucial learning experience that combined my love for gaming with a practical application of software engineering principles, ultimately making me a more skilled and disciplined programmer capable of tackling complex software projects.
