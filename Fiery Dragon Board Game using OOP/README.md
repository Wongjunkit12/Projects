# Fiery Dragon Board Game in Java using OOP

In this project, I designed and developed the "Fiery Dragons" board game, aimed at 2 to 4 players aged 5 to 99. The game revolves around dragons competing to reach their caves first while navigating a volcano-themed board. Utilising Java and OOP principles, I created a graphical user interface (GUI) with JavaFX to enhance the gameplay experience.

Through this project, I gained valuable insights into game design and development The agile-based development process, divided into four distinct sprints, taught me invaluable lessons about software architecture and design principles that is applicable in the real world in a professional environment. I learned how to effectively implement OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism to create modular and maintainable code. The process of designing the domain model for the game helped me understand the importance of defining clear relationships between entities, such as dragons, caves and cards. Additionally, I developed skills in user interface design, ensuring that the game was visually appealing and easy to navigate for players of all ages. Testing the game mechanics allowed me to refine gameplay balance and enhance user engagement. Overall, the iterative nature of the development, incorporating CRC cards and continuous critique, enhanced my understanding of code organization, UI design principles and the importance of maintainable, scalable architecture.
